  - No. There are many things that can be done in the GUI for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code but somethings cannot be done without the command line utilities.
  - Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code donâ€™t support all the features that are required for ASP.NET Core development, so there are times that using the command line is inevitable.
2. What kind of applications do the following templates create? Run these commands and read the documentation. A brief summary of each template is sufficient.
  - `dotnet new console --help` // Description: A project for creating a command-line application that can run on .NET Core on Windows, Linux and macOS

  - `dotnet new web --help` // Description: This template creates a project that is set up with the minimum code and content required for ASP.NET Core
development

    + `new globaljson` creates a json file, `--sdk-version` specifies the sdk version to specify inside the json file. `--output` specifies the directory to place the json file.
  - `dotnet new web --no-https --output MySolution/MyProject --framework netcoreapp3.1`
      + `new web` creates an empty .NET Core web project template.
      + `--no-https` turns https off for the project
      + `--framework` specifies the .NET Core framework version to use
4. What is the purpose of the global.json file?
  -  Specifies the version of .NET Core that will be used.
